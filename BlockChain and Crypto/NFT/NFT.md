"The most valuable NFT is worth more than $91.8 million" Surprising, isn't it?
Imagine it’s 2009. I send you a random photo and tell you that it’s worth millions of dollars. Would you believe it? That’s exactly what is happening right now. The only thing that has changed is that now you have to believe me!
But what exactly are NFT's? Let's explore a bit more about it. NFT stands for non-fungible tokens. According to economic times, NFT is a unit of data that is stored on a digital ledger (blockchain) and can be sold and traded. Its data units may be associated with digital files such as photos, videos, and audio. Each NFT may represent a different underlying asset and can have a different value, or have a digital signature.

You might be quizzed regarding the fungibility of a token. Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type. Let's see the differences between fungible and non-fungible tokens. Fungible assets can be sold in different forms and exchanges, and a non-fungible asset may require a little more time and care to be sold.
Let's assume you want to sell a diamond bracelet. If it were a fungible good, you'd be able to sell either the diamond and metal separately - or both together - at an appreciable price to multiple vendors for equal value.
However, the ultimate value of the diamond bracelet is based on several criteria like the clarity of the diamond, how the diamond is cut, and what kind of metal the bracelet is made of. Therefore, the price you would get from a pawn shop may be different from a jewelry store. As each diamond bracelet is unique, it is a non-fungible item. Here are some examples of fungible assets- Currency, Stocks and mutual funds, precious metals. Whereas real estate, trading cards, NFTs are examples of non-fungible assets.

NFTs are an investment, and every investment comes with its own set of pros and cons. Let's start with the positive stuff first:
Value Growth: NFTs can give a pretty good return on investment. For example, 'Bored Ape Yacht Club' NFT showed a whopping 58000% return on investment. Imagine buying a digital artwork of a monkey worth $140,000 (~ INR 1 crore). Right now, that's the value of this NFT.
Data Record: NFTs resolved an issue common to traditional arts: maintaining the chain-of-ownership. Since NFTs exist on blockchain technology, it is effortless to maintain ownership records of a particular digital artwork. With this new technology, we have successfully solved the problems bundled with the traditional method of managing purchases and ownership rights. It has led to reduced costs and a more efficient and streamlined management process.
Boom for Artists and Creatives: NFTs will add to your opportunities if you're an artist. Instead of selling your artwork in traditional local markets/websites, you can place them on a global platform as an NFT. You might become an overnight millionaire if someone invests big in it.
Benefits for the Aam Aadmi: You may ask this question: "Is it even useful for a common person like me?". Yes, it is! Monetary benefits for artists are merely one application of NFT technology. NFTs have the potential to replace traditional memberships or tickets for physical events. Soon, you might buy tickets for a concert or movie that are NFTs! The use of NFT is even beyond that. The limit is our creativity. It can even replace physical passports making our travel experience more luxurious.

Are you already drooling over the positives of NFTs? Hold back! They come with their own sets of negatives:
Environmental concerns: NFTs are based on blockchain technology. Maintaining and creating records on the blockchain requires a significant amount of computational energy. You might be thinking: why's that? For a blockchain network to survive, much electricity is consumed. Electricity consumption causes carbon emissions, and with the increasing popularity of blockchain technology, this is going to increase in the future.
NFTs and Fraud: Yes! You read it right! NFTs can be used to commit fraud. Recent reports suggest that some artwork has been illegally put on the NFT marketplace without the consent of the original artists. Fraudsters have successfully managed to impersonate the artist and benefit from their artwork.
Illiquid and volatile: NFTs are still emerging, and not many people know about these digital tokens. This means that NFTs, in the real world, don't have any value, and you can't exchange them for cash! Also, the price of an NFT depends on its demand in the market. And market demands keep changing over time, right? This makes the NFTs volatile.

If we talk about the cons of NFTs, there’s one thing that can’t be left out: Wash Trading and it requires some separate attention!


According to Wikipedia, Wash Trade is a form of market manipulation in which an investor simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments to create a misleading artificial activity in the marketplace.

For example, suppose there are three people, John, Martin, and Jack, where Jack and Martin are childhood friends.
So suppose Jack and Martin trade a financial asset like a share NFT between each other at a higher price than the market and compensate the money by cash in hand.

So to John, it would look like a legitimate legalized transaction, but it was just inter-account trading between two friends or a single group.

In the stock market, Wash trading is illegal, but in the crypto world, it's heavily followed because there are no rules and regulations and also new regulatory authorities.

Wash Trading solves two purposes in the crypto world-
Traffic- Cryptocurrency is highly biased by emotions or so-called “hype.” So the traffic created brings it on the trending page of all the cryptocurrency price tracker websites like coinmarketcap and coingecko, thus creating the so-called hype for naive investors.

Pump- NFT is selling rights on the blockchain of a particular commodity, so unlike cryptocurrency, NFT is auctioned on different websites like Opensea, Axie Infinity, and similar dApps.

So obviously, during resale, its price is going to increase due to wash trading (basic human psychology)

Now we come to talk about how can wash trading be detected in the crypto world?
We can use tools like bubble maps to find if a particular asset is traded between accounts that had inter-wallet transactions before.


Here each bubble represents a wallet, and lines represent a connection between wallets(inter-wallet transactions before)

Bubble maps are also highly useful in identifying rug pulls and shit coins in the crypto world.

In the end, buying NFT is a personal decision. Approach NFTs just like you would any investment: do your own research, understand the risks- including that you might lose all of your investing money-and if you decide to take the plunge, proceed with a healthy dose of caution.
